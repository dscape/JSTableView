#JSTableView

## What is it?

__JSTableView__ is a library which efficiently presents long, scrollable lists in HTML pages, inspired by the behavior of native iOS lists (UITableView).

## How does it work?
In native apps, these lists do not simply load up an entire set of data elements and scroll them up and down - rather, they only use enough cells to fill the viewing area. Cells that scroll out of the visible area are "recycled" and pushed onto the top or the bottom of the list, depending on the scroll direction - sort of like how the Druids might have moved a giant slab of stone in Ancient England, using rolling logs. As each log rolls out from the back of the stone, it is moved in front of the stone, and the process is repeated until Stonehenge is complete. This is comparatively efficient solution - there are a limited number of cells "in play" at any given point, taking up memory, requiring positioning and redrawing.

## Documentation

The source code is documented using [docco](//jashkenas.github.com/docco/) and you can find that documentation in the `docs` directory.

As for a quickstart, it really is as simple as including the source files and stylesheets, create a container object (I like using `divs`, but any block element will work) and, after the document has loaded (`$(document).ready()`, `$()`, or body onLoad), call `JSTableView.tableViewWithOptions`, passing in an options object as a parameter. The currently supported options are:

* __selector__: _[required]_ a CSS selector for an element which will serve as the container for the tableView. 

* __momentumFPS__: _[optional; default = 20]_ number of times per second to update the position of the list during momentum flow.

* __containerClassName__: _[optional; default = 'jsTableView']_ the className applied to the outer block container.

* __data__: _[optional; default = []]_ array of data elements. Data elements are objects composed of the following parameters:
 
    {
 
    __id__: _[optional; default = '']_ id to be applied to the list element.
 
    __className__: _[optional; default = '']_ className to be applied to the list element.
 
    __text__: _[optional; default = '']_ text added to the list element via innerHTML.
 
    __click__: _[optional]_ a function to be applied to the onClick event.
 
 	}
